## LACMA FY18 audience demographics analysis:

Major changes took place during FY18 for LACMA regarding their Annual Report, they conducted more surveys than any previous year, discontinued certain categories in ticketing, and made small changes to the way certain demographics questions were asked. I assessed the sample size of roughly 5,400 completed surveys, weighed the responses accordingly, and made recommendations in determining data collection quotas for individual programs and in aggregate to achieve optimal sample size for FY19. Once key data was aggregated it was formatted into LACMA’s standard Annual Report, but due to changes in ticketing and survey questions I expanded the report to show a more detailed breakdown and help create new benchmarks for future reports. After the report was completed, I created visualizations to be used in presentations such as a zip code heat map showing where in LA County most of LACMA’s visitors live.

## Continuing work:

We are currently in talks to perform further analysis on the survey data. Looking at topics such as, extracting and analyzing open field comments focusing on facilities, security, and perceived values; YoY analysis and visualization of selected data points; and visualizations of key demographic data against County, national, and other museums.
